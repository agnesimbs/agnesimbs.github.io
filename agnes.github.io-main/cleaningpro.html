			<h2>Process</h2>
			<!--
			<h4>Sketches</h4>
			<p>I sketched multiple user flows to visualize ideas quickly. My focus at this stage is to diverge first, converge later. Here are some early sketches of the Brand page.</p>

			<h4>Userflow</h4>
			<p>I mapped each flow with the events taken.</p>

			<h3>Wireframes</h3>
			<p>A sneak peek into my early wireframes, mid-fidelity designs and drafts. The designs have went through at least 10 iterations per screen. It is simply to improve the user experience.</p>
